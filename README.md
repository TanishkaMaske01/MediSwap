Mediswap: Bridging the Healthcare Gap

Created by: Tanishka Maske & Kalpana Karpate

-Overview Mediswap is an initiative designed to bridge the healthcare gap between urban and rural communities. The platform connects urban families who possess unused but unexpired medicines with rural populations in need, promoting equitable access to essential healthcare resources while minimizing medicine waste.

By utilizing technology-driven solutions, Mediswap revolutionizes how surplus medicines are collected, processed, and distributed across communities.

-Problem Statement

Every year, tons of usable medicines go to waste in urban homes, while rural areas suffer from medicine shortages.

Unused medicines are often discarded improperly, causing waste and environmental harm.

Many rural families lack access to affordable medicines and proper healthcare.

There is no unified system to connect surplus urban medicines with rural needs.

-Objective To collect, verify, and redistribute unused medicines from urban donors to rural recipients, ensuring safe and efficient delivery of essential healthcare products.

-The Mediswap Concept

Medicine Collection Mediswap collects unused, unexpired medicines from urban families through simple online pickup requests.

Technology Stack Developed using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website offers an intuitive interface for both donors and administrators. Users can log in, submit medicine information, and track contributions seamlessly.

Distribution Mechanism After collection, verified medicines are delivered to rural communities via NGO or healthcare partners, ensuring that every donation reaches someone in need.

Connection Bridge Mediswap connects urban surplus with rural scarcity, transforming waste into wellness and closing the healthcare divide.
